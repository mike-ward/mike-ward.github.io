**Note: Settings are now stored in an external file. Settings from
previous versions will not be migrated**

What's changed:

-   Works with all themes (finally)!
-   Patterns and colors stored in separate file.
    (`$APPDATA%/VsColorOutput/vscoloroutput.json`)  
    Share them with friends and family (other developers too).  
-   All settings, including colors in one place

-   Bug fixes

Things to do:

-   Not require a restart for color changes (this will likely require a
    change from Microsoft).
