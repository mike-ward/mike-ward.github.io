title: "VSColorOutput 2.0"
---

What's changed:

-   Works with all themes (finally)!
-   Patterns and colors stored in separate file.
    (`$APPDATA%/VsColorOutput/vscoloroutput.json`)  
    Share them with friends and family (other developers too).  
-   All settings, including colors in one place
