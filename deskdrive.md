###Desk Drive

Automatic drive/media shortcuts for your desktop

December 9, 2013 - Version 2.1 Released

Desk Drive solves a really annoying problem. You pop a USB thumb drive or DVD into your computer and then you have to open Window's Explorer and find the mapped drive or folder. Desk Drive adds a desktop icon pointing to the drive automatically. Remove the media and the shortcut goes away. Brilliantly simple and effective.

Desk Drive sits quietly in the system tray. Configuration (image at right) is just a click away and allows you to specify which types of media to monitor. So simple, it just works. Download it today!

The Desk Drive installer includes offers to install other programs which requires online access. Some of you have asked for an offline installer for use in corporate environments. You can now purchase one at https://sites.fastspring.com/mikeward/instant/deskdrive.
