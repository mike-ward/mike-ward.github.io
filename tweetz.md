It's easy to translate Tweetz Desktop. Find the file **tweetz.exe.locale** in
the install folder. Open it and follow the directions. Make sure to use a text
editor like Notepad and not a word processor (like Word). (Optional) If you
would like ""Translation by"" credit, include your name and a web address.

**Requires Windows 7 or Windows 8 and .NET 4.5.2
(<http://smallestdotnet.com/>)**

**Note to Reviewers:** Please review Tweetz Desktop for what it is and not what
it is not. Tweetz Desktop is based on the idea that less is sometimes more. It's
not a kitchen sink of features nor will it ever be.
