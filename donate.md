You're Awesome!

No, really you are. Less then 0.1% of the downloads (that I know about)
choose to donate. Your support is greatly appreciated.

**Do you like stickers?**

Donate $25 and get a couple of product stickers (pictured below). Want
more than two? Their an additional $5 each. You're PayPal account must
have a verified address. Leave a comment if you don't want stickers.

*I'm still working on a logo and stickers. It will likely be a few
months (at least) but I'll honor your $25 donation with stickers once I
get them.*
