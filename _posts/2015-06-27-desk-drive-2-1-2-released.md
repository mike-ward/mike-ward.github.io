Windows 10 is coming.

This has prompted me to update my programs to ensure a smooth transition when
Windows 10 arrives.

-   Remove monetizing applications from all installers.
-   Install programs in the local `App_Data` folder (no administrator
    privilege required)
-   Minimal installer UI
-   Update to latest version of .NET (4.5.2)

I've also taken to using [GithHub](https://github.com/mike-ward/DeskDrive) to
manage releases. Need an older version? You can get it directly from GitHub now.

This version also includes a new Czech translation.

Because I'm switching to a new installer technology, you'll have to manually
uninstall the older version of Desk Drive.

Available on the [Downloads Page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).
