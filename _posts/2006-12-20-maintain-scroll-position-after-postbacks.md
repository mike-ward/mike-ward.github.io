title:  Maintain Scroll Position after Postbacks
---
This is such a handy tip! In one line of code you can tell ASP.NET to maintain scoll position on postbacks. Very handy for long forms. I've already incorporated into [Bloget](/bloget). See more about it [here](http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/Maintain+Scroll+Position+After+Postbacks.aspx).
