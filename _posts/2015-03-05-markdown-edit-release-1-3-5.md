title: 'Markdown Edit Release 1.3.5'
---
[Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdownedit) 1.3.5 includes the following updated packages.

  - MahApps.Metro: the UI framework that gives Markdown Edit its modern look.
  - CommonMark.Net: the engine that converts Markdown to HTML and supplies the abstract syntax tree used for syntax highlighting.
  - NHunspell: the spell checker engine.

Also, the preview panel scrubs (sanitizes) the generated HTML in an effort to remove scripts and tags that can affect performance and stability.
