title: "Markdown Edit 1.13 Released"
---

It's been a steady drumbeat of releases this year for Markdown Edit. It
also appears that MDE may be getting some traction in the market (based
on search results). Still, I'm a bit surprised considering the dearth of
Markdown editors in the Windows desktop segment that MDE is not more
popular. I may be a bit biased here but MDE is clearly the best Markdown
editor for Windows. Obviously, you people are not doing your part
promoting it :).

If you love MDE, please write about (tweets, blogs, Facebook, etc.) I
also like hearing from you personally on how MDE is working for you (or
not). Send me email. My fragile male ego needs the occasional stroking.

OK, on to the release notes:

-   Save As HTML (`Alt+E`, `Alt+Shift+E`) added.
-   Convert from HTML. Drag and drop or open from the dialog. (Did you
    know you can open `.docx` files as well?)
-   New Danish translation. I just loves me some pull requests.
-   Add `Ctrl+,` to open/close the settings dialog.
-   Installer improvements. The installer was replacing shortcuts on
    upgrades which caused pinned shortcuts to break (it will take one
    more update cycle for this fix to take effect).

Future: I'm to the point where MDE does almost everything I want it to
do. There are some new releases of .NET and other third party libraries
on the horizon. Other than that, I don't have much in the way of
features on my to-do list. Got a cool idea for MDE? Shoot it my way.
