This release supports 280 character tweets. The strange and complex
twitter API just got a little weirder. One has to actually check three
different places in the payload for the text of the tweet (no kidding).
I suspect some of this is preserve backward compatibility.

I'll have a look at the issues to see if there are any quick
improvements I can make.
