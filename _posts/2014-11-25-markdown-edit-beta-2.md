title:  "Markdown Edit - Beta 2"
---
Version 0.2.7 is the last scheduled beta of [Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdownedit). This version is mostly bug fixes and other refinements. I did slip in a few new goodies.

- Ctrl+Shif+N opens a new instance
- Fixed bugs in the Find/Replace logic
- Add a few more themes (some more useful than others)
- Changed the logo
- Highlight current line option

Markdown Edit is free, contains no advertising or other monetizing gimmicks, is open source and MIT licensed.

If you want to build [Markdown Edit](https://github.com/mike-ward/Markdown-Edit), you'll need to use the Visual Studio 2015 Preview or later.

Send [feedback](mailto://mike@mike-ward.net) please. This has been the quietest beta cycle ever. I don't track downloads or other uses. The only information I get about usage is what you send me.
