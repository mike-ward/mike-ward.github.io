[Version
2.5](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MikeWard-AnnArbor.VSColorOutput)
is updated to support Visual Studio 2017. Visual Studio 2010 support has
been dropped because the Visual Studio Marketplace no longer accepts VS
2010 projects in the new *.visx* manifest format required for Visual
Studio 2017. If you need support for Visual Studio 2010 you can use the
[older 2.4
release](https://github.com/mike-ward/VSColorOutput/releases/tag/2.4).

There are several feature requests in GitHub I've yet to look at. I plan
to address them some point. Been busy on other projects.

And here's a shout out to everyone who has donated. I make an effort to
email a thank you to everyone who donates. These are not auto-generated
responses. I'm grateful for your support. It really does help.
