title: 'Cool Commands for Visual Studio 2005'
---
I just can't resist a good add on. Gaston Milano's [CoolCommands](http://weblogs.asp.net/gmilano/archive/2005/11/10/430240.aspx) is one of those Visual Studio addon's that just fits. The one feature I really like is the **Collapse All Projects** in the solution explorer. This feature alone is worth the download. Fellow blogger Jim Holms has a great review of it [here](http://visualstudiohacks.com/coolcommands). Get it now!
