Thing are settling down a bit. This drop includes:

  * User flyout dialog
  * Fix selected tweet highlight (I hope)
  * Move compose dialog back to bottom
  * UI tweeks

Targeting “In reply to” flyout dialog and “traditional retweets” for the next drop.

Available on the [downloads page](/downloads).
