[Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdownedit) is a Windows Desktop editor for [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) (a.k.a. Markdown). It emphasizes content and keyboard shortcuts over window-chrome and menus.

Markdown Edit would not have been possible without the unselfish help of other freeware authors. To paraphrase a famous physicist, "We stand on the shoulders of giants." Thanks goes out to the following in no particular order.

- [MahApps](http://mahapps.com/)
- [Avalon Edit](http://avalonedit.net/)
- [CommonMark.NET](https://github.com/Knagis/CommonMark.NET)
- [NHunspell](http://www.crawler-lib.net/nhunspell)
- [Json.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json)
- [GitHub](http://github.com)

If you use Markdown Edit, I only ask that you send me feedback, good or bad. Part of the fun of doing this is hearing how it works for you. I tend to forget this myself and have been making an effort to contact the freeware authors of products I use everyday just to let them know their work is appreciated.
