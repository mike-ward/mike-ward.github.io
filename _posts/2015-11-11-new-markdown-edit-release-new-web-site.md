title: "New Markdown Edit Release, New Web Site"
---

Today, Markdown Edit gets its own Web site. After all, the other
Markdown editors have their own site. Call it Web site envy. :)

There's also a new release of Markdown Edit, but for details you'll have
to go to the new web site at: <http://markdown.com>.
