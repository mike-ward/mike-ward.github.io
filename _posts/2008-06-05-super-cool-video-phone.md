title: 'Super Cool Video Phone'
---
Our new video phone just arrived today.

This little baby lets callers see each other. It uses a broadband Internet connection (VOIP). If the other caller only has a regular phone, you can still use voice. I literally plugged the power in, attached it to my Internet connection and started dialing (you dial and use it just like a regular phone). The VOIP provider has optimized their network for video and it shows. You can easily read a document displayed on the screen. Voice quality is better than my Vonage setup.

The cool part about this phone is that you can take it with you. The phone adapter is built in so you can plug it in wherever you have Internet access. We plan on taking it with us on vacations.

There's also a phone extension jack so you can plug the rest of your household phones into it. Cost is $28.99/month with unlimited long distance in North America. If the other caller is "in-network" then the call is free, world wide.
