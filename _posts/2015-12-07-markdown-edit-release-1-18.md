Time for another release. So what's new?

-   Smarter smart link pasting. MDE detects when you're pasting a link
    and converts it to the appropriate format. However, there are places
    where this is not the desired behavior. For instance, when pasting
    into a code or HTML block.

-   Block element backgrounds paint the entire block instead of just
    the text.

Here's an example:
