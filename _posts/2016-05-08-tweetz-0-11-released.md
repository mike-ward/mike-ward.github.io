---

What's changed:

-   Does not wake up the computer once it enters sleep. The type of
    network activity tweetz uses will not allow the computer to enter
    sleep mode if a new tweet arrives. However, once it enters sleep
    mode, tweetz will suspend network activity until the computer
    is restored.

-   Add full timestamp as a tooltip to the time of the tweet. #6

-   Add shortcuts to open tweets and open links in tweets. #7

-   Enhance crash detection and avoidance.
