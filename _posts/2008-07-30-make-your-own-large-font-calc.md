Under the category of stupid programmer tricks:

  1. Copy c:\windows\system32\calc.exe to some other file/path 
  2. File | Open File newcalc.exe in Visual Studio 
  3. Click on Dialog - 101 
  4. In the properties, modify Font(Size) for your favorite font and size 
  5. Close the solution, this will save the newly-modified exe

I'm easily entertained.
