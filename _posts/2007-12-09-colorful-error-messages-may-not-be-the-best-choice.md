title: 'Colorful error messages may not be the best choice'
---
The error message below appeared on our corporate intranet site the other day. 

While I can empathize with the programmer's frustration here it was not a good choice. Especially since it is likely offensive to some. Still, I did get a chuckle. Word to the wise, always remember that your work is public whether source code, log messages or UI. I would not want to be this programmer or his supervisor for that matter when management comes calling.
