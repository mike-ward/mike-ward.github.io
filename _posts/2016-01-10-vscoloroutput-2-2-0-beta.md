Added time stamps to the debug output window as pictured:

Yes, they're optional.

-   The first number is the time since the beginning of the
    debug session.
-   The second is the difference between the current and last time.
-   If the current and last time are the same, it doesn't bother to
    show it. This makes it simpler to see the differences.
-   It's experimental at this point until I get a sense of how stable
    it is.
-   Also, bug fixes.

Send me feedback.
