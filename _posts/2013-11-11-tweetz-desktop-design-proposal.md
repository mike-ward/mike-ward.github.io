I'm toying around with the idea of not scrolling in new tweets as they arrive. Instead, a notification area near the top would indicate the number of new tweets available. Click on the notification area and the timeline updates. This is similar to how the Web interface works. The way it works now kind of feels wrong at some level. Thoughts?
