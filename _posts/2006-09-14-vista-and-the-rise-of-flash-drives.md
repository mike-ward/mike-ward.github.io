[Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) has an excellent article on a new feature in Vista called [ReadyBoost](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/foreveryone/performance.mspx). Includes benchmarks for different flash drives and a discussion of hybrid hard drives that incorporate flash to boost performance.
