title:  Visual Studio 2017 Installer Quick Tip  
...

I hadn't realized until today that you can select individual components in the new Visual Studio Installer. In particular, the Community Edition does not install the .NET 4.7 targeting pack by default. There are some significant upgrades in this runtime for desktop applications like my [Markdown editor](http://markdownedit.com/).

As pictured below, click on the **Individual components** tab and then select the .NET 4.7 target pack.

I like the organization of this view. It lays items out in a flat list and does not require opening subtrees to get at selections. The other item I found useful to add is the Typescript 2.2 SDK.
