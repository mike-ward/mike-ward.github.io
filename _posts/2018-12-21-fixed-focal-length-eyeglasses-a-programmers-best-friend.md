title: "Fixed Focal-Length Eyeglasses, a Programmer's Best Friend"  
...

There was a time when my visual acuity was, "off the charts". I could
read signs from further away than anyone I knew in my youth. Alas, as I
aged, my vision changed and now I wear eyeglasses. In fact, I wear
bifocals (progressives).

While bifocals are OK for laptops (barely), they cause me to tilt my
head up to an uncomfortable angle for desktops. Also, there's a weird
spherical effect on wider screens when using bifocals.

In a word, bifocals suck for programming.

I tried reading glasses which are really fixed focal-length glasses.
Said another way, they're designed to focus at a specific distance. I've
found the reader glasses available at pharmacies and other stores work
fine for laptops, but not for desktops. So what's a programmer to do?

I went to my optometrist and asked for, "reading glasses" with a longer
focal length. How long? I used the length of my arm. I simply held out
my arm and said that's the length I need my reading glasses to focus at.
A few measurements and a hundred dollars later and I now have eyeglasses
that allow me to program all day long without eye strain.
