title: "Markdown Edit 1.10 - GitHub Flavored Markdown"
---

Many of you have asked for GitHub flavored markdown support, primarily for
generating tables. The additional Markdown features are documented
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). The Markdown
Edit previewer will not show syntax highlighting in code blocks.

The indicators on the title bar for word-wrap, spell checking and auto-save are
now buttons. You can use the keyboard shortcuts or click on the indicators to
toggle the function.

A new, "Revert" command has been added. It will reload the current document. If
the document has been edited, it will ask before reloading. The command is
activated by pressing `F5`.

This version requires .NET 4.6, up from .NET 4.5.2. You can get it at

Available on the [Downloads Page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).
