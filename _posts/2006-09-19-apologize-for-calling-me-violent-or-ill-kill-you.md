title: 'Apologize For Calling Me Violent Or I''ll Kill You'
---
I [wrote](http://mike-ward.net/2006/09/19/apologize-for-calling-me-violent-or-ill-kill-you) about this issue earlier. This [guy](http://suspiria.org/2006/09/apologize_for_calling_me_viole.html) hits the mark in fewer words. 

I'm only guessing here, but I'm pretty sure that in any of the Middle Eastern languages there must not be a word that means the same as the word "IRONY" in English. 

On the heels of the Pope's comments concerning the violent aspects of Islam's founding (forced conversion or death), Muslims across the Middle East have expressed outrage that he would falsely accuse "The religion of peace" of such things by: 

- Burning the Pope in effigy.  
- Burning 7 Christian churches to the ground.  
- Murdering a Catholic nun.  
- Threatening that this will lead to war.  


If I didn't know better, I'd think this came from one of the sarcastic articles at [TheOnion.com](http://theonion.com) or a Saturday Night Live skit, but sadly (or is that frighteningly?) it's for real.
