Markdown Edit is a Windows desktop editor for creating Markdown documents. Here's what it looks like:

Is it better than other Markdown editors? Probably not. Is it different? A little.

Markdown editors are relatively easy to write because of the great tooling provided by others ([AvalonEdit](http://avalonedit.net/) and [CommonMark.Net](https://github.com/Knagis/CommonMark.NET)). My contribution is mostly packaging.

Markdown Edit places an emphasis on content by promoting the use of keyboard shortcuts and minimum window chrome. There are no menus and only a few dialogs. Settings are in plain text files that you have to edit (quickly access these files using keyboard shortcuts).

This is the first public release so there's bound to be some rough spots and crashes. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and am satisfied that it's stable and safe enough for some user testing.

The [Markdown Edit](/markdownedit) page has a comments button at the bottom where you can leave comments and suggestions. Or use the GitHub repo if that's your thing.
