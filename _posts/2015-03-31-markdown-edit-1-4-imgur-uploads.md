title: 'Markdown Edit 1.4 - Imgur Uploads'
---
Uploading and hosting images for Markdown documents just got a whole lot easier. [Imgur](http://imgur.com) is a free image hosting service. It doesn't require signing up (although you can get some extra goodies if you do).

[Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdownedit), hero of the Markdown world and defender of the simple interface, provides a elegant way upload images to Imgur and insert the link into your document. Here's how you do it.

1. Drag and drop the image onto Markdown Edit
2. Send me an email saying how much you love it. (optional)

Don't believe me? I have video!

But wait, there's more. You can also paste images from the clipboard.

I've also added some buttons to the title bar to open and save documents.
