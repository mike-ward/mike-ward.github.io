title: 'Markdown Edit 1.0.3 Released'

Another minor update to [Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdownedit), my Windows desktop Markdown editor.

  - New "Paper" theme
  - Syntax highlighting for lists
  - Insure scroll to bottom of preview at document end
  
In using the "Paper" theme for it's Zen-like qualities. I've found that changing to font to `Courier New` and the font size to `17.0` provides a better editing experience. Other "Zen-like" editors use similar settings. Something to try. Here's a screen shot.
