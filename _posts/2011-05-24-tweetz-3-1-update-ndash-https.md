title: 'tweetz 3.1 Update &ndash; HTTPS'
---
This is a beta release. It should address the problems reported with twitter accounts enabled to accept HTTPS only. It’s not that big of a change code-wise but considering the shift to HTTPS (the gadget always uses HTTPS now) I thought I would spin it as a beta to get some testing and feedback. You can download it [here](/downloads).

If things don’t work out for you, you can fall back to the last stable release (3.1.5.0) from the [downloads page](/downloads).

I’ve also updated the Dutch translation and added a new Finnish translation (Thanks everyone!).
