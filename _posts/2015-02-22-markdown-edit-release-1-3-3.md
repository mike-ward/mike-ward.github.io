title: 'Markdown Edit 1.3.3 Released'

[Markdown Edit](http://mike-ward.net/markdownedit) 1.3.3 is all about cosmetics.

-   **Background matches Editor Background Color** - When viewing only the
    editor and not the preview, the window background matches the editor
    background. This make the background seamless with the editor, which is less
    distracting in my opinion. Strictly cosmetic.

-   **Smaller Horizontal Scrollbar** - Matches the width of the vertical
    scrollbar.

Available on the [Downloads Page](http://mike-ward.net/downloads).
