title: 'Electric Storage Solution Charges in 5 Minutes and Drives 500 Miles'
---
I've blogged earlier about electric cars in "[The Future is Electric](/2006/08/22/the-future-of-cars-is-electric/)". I really want one and it looks like there are several technologies coming together that could make this possible. The latest innovation comes from a company in Texas called EEStor that has developed a storage device that can hold enough electricity to drive 500 miles and it only takes 5 minutes to recharge. The [story](http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/15/technology/disruptors_eestor.biz2/index.htm) first broke on CNN Money.

Using something called an Ultra Capacitor, they store a charge without using hazardous chemicals or high pressure tanks. The cost of the engine is slightly more expensive (whatever that means) than a gasoline engine but getting rid of the need for gas more than compensates for the added expense. Could this be the breakthrough we've been waiting for in electrics?
